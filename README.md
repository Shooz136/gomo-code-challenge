# Gomo Code Challenge

This is a web-based solution to the gomo code challenge.

## Getting Started

These instructions will build and install a copy of the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Node.js & Node Package Manager (NPM) - https://nodejs.org/en/download/
Angular CLI installed globally - https://angular.io/cli

### Installing

First, clone the repository locally.

```
git clone https://github.com/Shooz136/gomo-code-challenge
```

Then, navigate to the cloned repository and install your dependencies - make sure dev dependencies install as well.

```
npm install
```

Then, run the Angular development server.  The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

```
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. 

## Running Unit Tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
